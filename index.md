### 5.1 TPT: Beneficial and corresponding Harmful Effects of Computing
1. Through the internet we are able to communicate with people from all around the world. Social media networks such as facebook allow us to chat with friends and family in a matter of seconds.
2. Through the internet and various social media networks, a harmful effect is cyber bullying. It is very easy for people to make fun of and bully others using social media, since they don't have to see one another face to face.
3. Through the internet we are able to purchase things online. This makes shopping more convenient and efficient, since things can be purchased from the comfort of one's home. Another benefit of this is that many buisness are able to run fully online, which eliminates a lot of overhead costs and increases profit margins.
### 5.1 TPT: Dopamine Issues
- Dopamine issues are a very real thing in modern society, especially for youner people. Technology is very addicting because of the never ending novelty it provides. There is always a new game, a new video, a new article, etc. This makes it hard to stop once a person starts using it. Another issue is the fact that we always carry around our phones with us, which makes it very easily accesible and distracting. In the past I have had dopamine issues with Youtube. Due to the infitine supply of videos, I found myself neglecting work because I couldn't control my usage. I have countered the issue by finding more productive things I'm interested in and focusing on that.
### 5.2 TPT: How does someone empower themself in a digital world?
- To be empowered in a digital world means to be knowledgable. It doesn't matter if you have the latest technology if you don't know how to use it. It is important to be educated in modern technology to stay on top of things. 
### 5.2 TPT: How does someone that is empowered help someone that is not empowered? Describe something you could do at Del Norte HS.
- An empowered person can help an unempowered person by teaching them the things they know about the internet and its usages, as well as possibly helping them get access to the internet and electronics if they don't arleady. Something I could do for example is share my laptop if a person needs it, or explain how something works to them so they're not so confused.
### 5.2 TPT: Is paper or red tape blocking digital empowerment? Are there such barriers at Del Norte? Elsewhere?
I would say that red tape is blocking digital empowerment. This is due to the fact that inorder to have access to the internet a number of steps must be met first. A person needs to be in a place with a good connection, they need to have the tools and means neccesary to learn and become educated on what they're doing, and they must have the financial ability to afford the techonology itself. I don't think these barriers exist at Del Norte because our school is very lucky to have access and the ability to give everyone laptops and chromebooks. On the other hand, schools in not so well off neighborhoods have barriers due to lack of technology.
