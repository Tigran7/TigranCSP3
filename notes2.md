# TPT 5.5 License type
- Our group chose to use the MIT liscence. We did this because it means that other people can use our code in their own porjects. Since this type of liscence is a permissive free software license, it only puts limited restriction on reuse, therefore the code can be used within proprietary software as long as a copy of the MIT license is included

# TPT 5.6 Safe Conputing
- Describe PII you have seen on project in CompSci Principles.
I have seen PII like first and last names, as well as emails and even phone numbers.
- What are your feelings about PII and your exposure?
I feel that it is alright to have only the most basic PII out for other people to see, more personal detials like phone numbers and adresses shouldn't be exposed, and I find that when they are exposed it's very unfair to the owners.
- Describe good and bad passwords? What is another step that is used to assist in authentication.
Good passwords are ones that are very hard to guess, meaning completely random numbers and letters. It needs to have a mix of capital and lowercase as well as random characters as well. Things like Bob 123 are not very safe.
Try to describe Symmetric and Asymmetric encryption.
In Symmetric-key encryption the message is encrypted by using a key and the same key is used to decrypt the message which makes it easy to use but less secure. It also requires a safe method to transfer the key from one party to another. Asymmetric Key Encryption is based on public and private key encryption technique. It uses two different key to encrypt and decrypt the message. It is more secure than symmetric key encryption technique but is much slower.
- Provide and example of encryption we used in deployment.
The SSH key that we need to have in order to link our deployed site to the server is an example.
- Describe a phishing scheme you have learned about the hard way. Describe some other phishing techniques.
One I've learned the hard way from is emails when I was younger saying that I won something, because I would often times click on those. Other phishing techniques include tech support scams, or infected attatchements.
