#License type
- Our group chose to use the MIT liscence. We did this because it means that other people can use our code in their own porjects. Since this type of liscence is a permissive free software license, it only puts limited restriction on reuse, therefore the code can be used within proprietary software as long as a copy of the MIT license is included
