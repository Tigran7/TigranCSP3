# TPT 5.3/5.4 notes
## Computer Bias 5.3
- Does the owner of the computer think this was intentional?
Definitly not because first off he actually found it amusing, and second off it doesn't make sense for a multi billion dollar corporation to try and completely eliminate an entire race from their userbase on purpose.
- How do you think this happened?
I think that the people developing the camera feature were only using white people as models and only tested it on white people instead of including a diverse group of people.
- Is this harmful? Was it intended to be harmful or exclude?
Yes this is harmful because it discriminates people of color from using the feature, anad therefore rendering the computer to be useless to them. It was not intentional, but rather a mistake on the part of the developers and testers.
- Should it be corrected?
Yes it should so that there is no computer bias in the system and everyone is included
- What would you or should you do to produce a better outcome?
The developers need to create models with different skin colors, and then test it on different people with different skin colors.
## Crowdsourcing 5.4
- CompSci has 150 principles students. Describe a crowdsource idea and how you might initiate it in our environment?
An exapmle of a crowdsourcing idea would be to make a survey on wheter or not people enjoyed the class. In order to get everyone's opinion and remove any biases, I can make a google form with the survey on their, and the link to the google form can be on the white board of the classroom so that if anyone is having tech errors they can still see the link.
- What about Del Norte crowdsourcing? 
For Del Norte crowdsourcing we could play a message on the announcments so that everyone is gauranteed to hear it.
- Could your final project be better with crowdsourcing?
Yes because crowdsourcing means that we will get the absolute most diverse population possible, and there will be a lot less bias and therefore our project will be more applicable to the general public
